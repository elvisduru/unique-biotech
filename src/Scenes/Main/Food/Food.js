              <p>Our goal is to reduce food waste in landfills, restaurants, hotels, fast food, etc., across the country and increase the overall efficiency of organic recycling. With our exclusive technology we are able to bio-convert organic waste rapidly, thereby enhancing sustainability.</p>
              <p>Black Soldier Fly larvae feed on existing organic waste and convert into a sustainable source of natural protein. The bio-conversion process takes organic waste streams from consumerâ€™s food, markets (i.e. fruits and vegetables), farms (Poultry droppings),  restaurants &amp; fast foods (food waste), etc. and recycles these into valuable products: such as Larvae Meal, Dried insect larvae rich in protein which can be fed to livestock and fish, an extracted oil from larvae is used as a livestock additive for healthy immune systems and what is left behind is a rich and powerful fertilizer and soil additive with natural pest repellent properties. </p>
